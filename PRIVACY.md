- What information do you collect?
Presently collects your location information (if provided), or else will attempt to determine it from your IP address.
This is longitude/latitude accurate to 3 decimal points, which is about as precise as the intersection of two streets.
- How do you use the information?
Presently uses this location information to get the local weather. Weather varies by neighborhood, and weather APIs may acquire or lose weather stations, so precise location data is important for getting accurate weather.
Along with weather, Presently also gets local weather alerts, such as wildfire, tornado, or landslide warnings.
Presently caches this weather and alert data locally on your machine for 1-2 hours. This helps keep Presently fast; when you open a new tab it will initially display the cached data while it searches for fresh data.
- What information do you share?
Presently implicitly shares your location data when fetching the weather. For example, if you use the US Government API (default), Presently will send your latitude and longitude directly to the US Government weather APIs.
Unfortunately, Presently cannot guarantee what the APIs do with your location data, but as these are popular APIs there is some safety in numbers.
If you wear a tinfoil hat, you may consider using an alternate (non-government) API, although you will need to provide an API key (free, duckduckgo the API for instructions on how to acquire one).

Presently does not ever share your location with third parties.
- How do I delete my data?
Click on the hamburger menu (three lines) in the top left of Presently. From there, scroll down to the bottom and click "Delete my data". Presently will explain what data you are deleting and ask for confirmation.
